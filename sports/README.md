We're revamping the way we do BYOD to provide a simple user interface that allows you to:

- connect a database and keys
- ingest your database and choose what to query over
- conduct queries over your data

We're testing this with spots, and hoping that we can bring this over to BYOD in the near future.

## API

- Follow the instructions in the API folder

## Client

There's currently two clients:

- The streamlit app is a simple quick and easy query solution

- The nextjs client provides a bit more customization. The dev that's working on it doesn't know streamlit that well and hopefully nextjs is easy to iterate on quickly anyway for adding more features.
